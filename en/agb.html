    <h1>General Terms and Conditions</h1>

    <h2>§ 1 Scope and Target Group</h2>
    <p>
      These terms apply to all services provided by Julian Hofmann in the context of deal sourcing and contact facilitation. The offerings are aimed exclusively at entrepreneurs within the meaning of § 14 BGB and high-net-worth individuals with verified investment interest from EUR 1,000,000. Cooperation with consumers as defined in § 13 BGB is excluded.
    </p>

    <h2>§ 2 Scope of Service</h2>
    <p>
      Julian Hofmann exclusively provides contact-facilitating services in the off-market sector ("gate opening"). This includes the identification, prequalification, and connection to owners of potentially sellable businesses. There is no valuation, legal or tax advice, investment advice, or regulated intermediation (§ 34f GewO, KWG, VAG).
    </p>

    <h2>§ 3 Scope of Performance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Identification of target companies matching the client’s search profile</li>
      <li>Internal prequalification (no valuation or consulting)</li>
      <li>Convincing owners to sell (if required)</li>
      <li>Connecting with decision-making owners</li>
      <li>No influence on negotiations or contract structuring</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>§ 4 Requirements for Cooperation</h2>
    <p>Proof of available capital of at least EUR 1,000,000 is required for engagement. Accepted proof includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bank confirmation</li>
      <li>Account statement (redacted except for amount and name)</li>
      <li>Notarized statement of assets</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Not sufficient: verbal statements, non-binding expressions of interest, or Excel spreadsheets.</p>

    <h2>§ 5 Success Criteria</h2>
    <p>A successful referral occurs when a qualified connection to a target company results in an economic transaction.</p>
    <p>Transactions include in particular:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Acquisition of shares (share deal)</li>
      <li>Acquisition of assets (asset deal)</li>
      <li>Shell purchase, trust structures, silent partnerships, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Indirect deals via third parties or affiliates are also commissionable if the initial contact came from the contact provider.</p>
    <p>A qualified proposal exists only if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name, location, and description of the target company are provided</li>
      <li>Consent to contact is present</li>
      <li>A first conversation has been initiated or facilitated</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The introduction is deemed complete once this information is submitted in writing and the client approves disclosure of their identity.</p>

    <h2>§ 6 Compensation (Success Fee)</h2>
    <p><strong>Tiers:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>7% of the purchase price up to EUR 10 million</li>
      <li>5% on EUR 10–50 million</li>
      <li>3% on EUR 50–100 million</li>
      <li>2% from EUR 100 million</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Early Payment Discount (if paid within 10 calendar days):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>6% up to EUR 10 million</li>
      <li>4% on EUR 10–50 million</li>
      <li>1.5% on EUR 50–100 million</li>
      <li>1% from EUR 100 million</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Payment Terms:</strong></p>
    <p>The success fee is due no later than 14 calendar days after closing. Payment from target company funds is only allowed if parallel proof of capital of EUR 1,000,000 is provided. Installments are only allowed upon prior written agreement.</p>

    <p><strong>Anti-Splitting Clause:</strong></p>
    <p>Split or staged transactions are considered a single economic unit. Acquisitions via third parties, affiliates, or trustees are also subject to the success fee.</p>

    <h2>§ 7 Contract Duration & Tail Clause</h2>
    <p>The agreement is non-terminable during ongoing processes. Termination outside of active processes is only possible if no proposals have been submitted for two months.</p>
    <p>Already introduced targets remain subject to commission – regardless of the time elapsed before a transaction (tail clause).</p>
    <p>The service is free until success. Payment is only due in case of a successful transaction.</p>

    <h2>§ 8 Default</h2>
    <p>In case of payment default, the client owes default interest of 5% p.a. and reimbursement of dunning costs. Before legal action, a written reminder with a deadline will be issued.</p>

    <h2>§ 9 Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>All information and contacts obtained during the cooperation must be treated confidentially. Disclosure is only permitted to advisors, financiers, or due diligence reviewers in the context of a potential transaction.</p>

    <h2>§ 10 Final Provisions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Place of jurisdiction: Dresden</li>
      <li>Applicable law: exclusively German law</li>
      <li>Changes and side agreements require written form</li>
      <li>If any provision of these terms is invalid, the remainder remains valid</li>
    </ul>
