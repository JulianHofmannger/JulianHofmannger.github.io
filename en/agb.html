    <h1>General Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective: May 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>§ 1 Scope and Target Audience</h2>
    <p>
      This website and all services provided by Julian Hofmann are directed exclusively at business entities as defined under §14 of the German Civil Code (BGB), as well as high-net-worth individuals with a professional investment interest of €1,000,000 or more. The provider explicitly excludes business relationships with consumers as defined in §13 BGB.
    </p>

    <h2>§ 2 Scope of Services</h2>
    <p>
      The provider offers non-binding, informal introductions to potential off-market targets (“gate opening”). These services do not constitute regulated activities (e.g., under §34f GewO, KWG, or VAG), nor are they advisory, evaluative, or intermediary in nature. No legal, tax, or investment advice is provided.
    </p>

    <h2>§ 3 No Brokerage Contract</h2>
    <p>
      The provider acts solely as an introducer and does not guarantee any successful transaction outcome. No brokerage or intermediary agreement is established. The provider is under no obligation to advise, inform, or document as would be required under broker or financial supervision laws.
    </p>

    <h2>§ 4 Compensation</h2>
    <p>
      Unless otherwise agreed in writing, a flat introducer’s fee (“Finder’s Fee”) of 7% of the final purchase price shall apply. The fee becomes due upon signing of the transaction agreement and is payable net within 10 calendar days without deduction. All taxes, duties, and incidental transaction costs are borne by the client.
    </p>

    <h2>§ 5 Disclaimer of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      The provider accepts no liability for business decisions, financial losses, or damages arising from the use of the information or contacts provided. Liability is limited—except where otherwise required by law—to intent and gross negligence.
    </p>

    <h2>§ 6 Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>
      All data, information, and contacts received or transmitted during the collaboration must be treated strictly confidential by the client. Disclosure to third parties is permitted only with the provider’s prior written consent.
    </p>

    <h2>§ 7 No Right of Withdrawal</h2>
    <p>
      No statutory right of withdrawal applies, as services are offered exclusively to business customers under §14 BGB and are custom-tailored (§312g(2)1 BGB).
    </p>

    <h2>§ 8 Jurisdiction and Applicable Law</h2>
    <p>
      German law shall apply exclusively, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Jurisdiction is Dresden, Germany, where legally permissible. If any provision of these terms is found to be invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected.
    </p>

    <h2>§ 9 Contact</h2>
